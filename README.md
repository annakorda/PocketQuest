# PocketQuest  
**Ligand Binding Site Prediction using Surface Geometry and Machine Learning**

PocketQuest is a Python-based machine learning pipeline developed as the final project for the Structural Bioinformatics and Python Programming courses. It predicts protein-ligand binding sites by analyzing 3D molecular surface features at Connolly points and classifies them using an optimized XGBoost model trained on tens of millions of surface points.

---

##  Project Overview

We developed a tool that:
- Extracts **Connolly points** from protein surfaces using MSMS.
- Computes **geometric, chemical, and residue-based features** around each point.
- Labels surface points as **binding vs non-binding** using ligand proximity.
- Trains an XGBoost model with **Optuna hyperparameter optimization**.
- Classifies and **clusters high-probability binding points**.
- Outputs **predicted binding sites as PDB files and Chimera visualizations**.

Our training dataset is based on curated protein-ligand complexes from **BindingDB**, covering a wide diversity of functional classes.

---

## Input & Labeling

- Connolly points generated with a **1.6 Ã… probe**.
- Points labeled as binding if within **4.0 Ã… of a ligand non-H atom**.
- Over **10 million points** used for training (positive class ratio: ~5.5%).
Labels:
- `0 = non-binding`  
- `1 = binding-site point`

---

## Output Files
If you clone the repository and run PocketQuest.py, two new directories will be created, files
(contains temporary files) and **results**:
- `results/*.pdb`: Predicted binding-site residue files.
- `results/results.log`: Cluster scores (based on summed probabilities).
- `results/*.cmd`: Chimera visualization scripts.
- `results/*.png`: Snapshot images (if `-vis` option is enabled).

---

## Dataset Availability

Due to GitHub storage limits:
- Only scripts, logs, and trained model are provided
- Full datasets (raw PDBs, Connolly surfaces) can be shared upon request via Google Drive.
