# PocketQuest  
**Ligand Binding Site Prediction using Surface Geometry and Machine Learning**

PocketQuest is a Python-based machine learning pipeline developed as the final project for the Structural Bioinformatics and Python Programming courses. It predicts protein-ligand binding sites by analyzing 3D molecular surface features at Connolly points and classifies them using an optimized XGBoost model trained on tens of millions of surface points.

---

##  Project Overview

We developed a tool that:
- Extracts **Connolly points** from protein surfaces using MSMS.
- Computes **geometric, chemical, and residue-based features** around each point.
- Labels surface points as **binding vs non-binding** using ligand proximity.
- Trains an XGBoost model with **Optuna hyperparameter optimization**.
- Classifies and **clusters high-probability binding points**.
- Outputs **predicted binding sites as PDB files and Chimera visualizations**.

Our training dataset is based on curated protein-ligand complexes from **BindingDB**, covering a wide diversity of functional classes.

## How to Use PocketQuest

To run PocketQuest, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas xgboost scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
```

For visualization, install UCSF Chimera from:  
https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html

Then, clone the repository, move into the project directory and install PocketQuest:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annakorda/PocketQuest
cd PocketQuest/
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run the prediction pipeline using:

```bash
pocketquest [-h] -i PDB [-distance DISTANCE] [-size SIZE] [-max_residues MAX_RESIDUES] [-prob PROB] [-vis VIS] [-rotate]
```
Where:
- `-i`: input PDB file
- `-prob`: probability threshold for Connolly point classification
- `-distance`: clustering distance threshold (in Ã…)
- `-size`: minimum number of points to form a valid cluster
- `-max_residues`: maximum number of residues allowed per cluster
- `-vis`: number of top clusters to visualize
- `-rotate`: reorients the protein if the PDB by default is shown from above. (e.g. transmembrane proteins)

The output files, including predicted pockets (`.pdb`) and visualization images (`.png`), will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Example
You can try to run the pipeline with the provided PDB file, 3lfz.pdb, with the following command:

```bash
pocketquest -i 3lfz.pdb -prob 0.9 -distance 3 -size 4 -max_residues 30 -vis 3 -rotate
```
